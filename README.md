<h1 align="center">Judo</h1>
Judo is a low power transmitter based on tunnel diode-based self-oscillating mixer (SoM).
This repo is all the experimental data and visualisation scripts used for the paper Judo.

## Experiment Overview

- **Experiment 1**: Compare the performance difference between Judo tag and Lorea tag with CC1310 launchpad as receiver.
- **Experiment 2**: Compare SoM harmonic performance with different baseband waveforms (sin and square).
- **Experiment 3**: Compare the performance difference between injection-locked mode and free-running mode.
- **Experiment 4**: Conversion loss test varying baseband signal strength.
- **Experiment 5**: Conversion loss test varying baseband signal frequency.
- **Experiment 6**: Mixed signal comparison between injection-locked mode and near injection-locked mode.
- **Experiment 7**: The spectrum of reflection amplifier with different carrier signal strength.
- **Experiment 8**: Judo communication quality evaluation, outdoor bistatic.
- **Experiment 9**: Judo communication quality evaluation, indoor monostatic.
- **Experiment 10**: Mixed signal comparison with different carrier strength.
