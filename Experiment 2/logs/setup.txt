Baseband signal: square vs sinusoidal on the spectrum
Three different voltages

Experiment 2:

I1: Square signal, 35 MHz spectrum captured
P-P voltage: 50mv

I2: Square signal, 10 MHz spectrum captured
P-P voltage: 50mv

I3: Sinusoidal signal, 2 MHz spectrum captured
P-P: Voltage: 50 mV

i4: Sinusoidal signal, 10 MHz spectrum captured
P-P voltage: 50 mV

i5: Sinusoidal singla, 2 MHz spectrum
P-P Voltage: 250 mV

i6: Sinusoidal signal, 10 MHz spectrum captured
P-P voltage: 250 mV

i7: Square signal, 35 Mhz spectrum
P-P: Voltage 250 mV

i8: Square signal, 10 Mhz spectrum
P-P: Voltage 250 mV

Square signal fed into TDO becomes extremely unstable and spread over very widebandwidth especially at higher voltages
