Experiment 1
Probe the minimum carrier strength to achive the injection locking. The experiments are done in challenging environment
Carrier gain: 0 to 90
Rx centeral frequency:864.64Hz
Rx parameters: filter BW 155kHz, frequency deviation 15kHz
Rx position: 25m away from the backsplatter tag
Carrier postion: 25m away from the backsplatter tag

Experiment 2
Investigate the injection locking stability in challenging environment
People walking around for 30s

Experiment 3
Carrier postion: 60m away NLOS from the backsplatter tag
Rx position: 10 20 30m away from the tag and the postions are in between the tag and carrier
