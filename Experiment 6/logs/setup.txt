Experiment 4: TDO modulated with a sinusoidal signal 250 mV p-P, 200kHz offset away. TDO located half meter away from the spectrum analyser.  SDR located in coffee room and we increase the strength of the carrier signal to find strength when it injection locks to the TDO.

I1: No carrier
I2: Carrier TXgain: 70
I3: Carrier TXgain: 80
I4: Carrier tx gain: 90
I5: Carrier tx gain: 60 (close, not locking)
i6: Carrier tx gain: 65 (close, not locking)

Next are only SDR, no TDO
i7: TX gain 65
i8: TX gain 60
i9: tx gain 70	
i10: txgain 80
i11: txgain 90
